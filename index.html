			<p> In 2013, the NYC Office of Environmental Remediation launched a program called the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/oer/safe-land/clean-soil-bank.page">Clean Soil Bank</a> (CSB), with the goal of reusing soil excavated at construction sites around the city. The CSB works as a matchmaker, picking up soil and delivering it to other construction sites where it can be used.
			</p>

			<p> Analysis of an <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Clean-Soil-Bank-Generating-and-Receiving-Sites/b4dv-8mq4">OER database</a> available on the <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC Open Data portal</a>, detailing 137 soil transfers, paints a picture of soil-bearing trucks criss-crossing the city â€” and just beyond; the Bronx received 11.9K tons of soil from New Rochelle in Westchester County through the program. The amount and distribution of soil varied widely. Brooklyn construction sites produced the most soil recycled by the program, with the Bronx contributing the least. Soil excavated in Brooklyn and Queens found its way to all five boroughs, but every ton of soil unearthed on Staten Island and contributed to the CSB stayed on Staten Island. Manhattan construction sites received the least soil through the CSB, while more than half (51.5%) of all soil distributed through the CSB was delivered to Staten Island.

			<p> By keeping NYC soil in the city, the CSB reduces number of truck miles driven, lowering fuel consumption as well as greenhouse gases and local pollution emitted from the trucks. In September 2020, the City expanded the project's capacity by opening a permanent stockpile in East New York, Brooklyn. </p>

			<p> "We are pleased to benefit the environment, support agency and community projects, and save taxpayers money," said Mark McIntyre, Director of the Office of Environmental Remediation, of the project. </p>


			<p> With all that soil being trucked around the city, some boroughs ended up with less soil than they contributed, while others saw a net gain in soil from the program. Queens lost the most soil, while Staten Island added the most. According to the OER database, 55.4K tons of the soil sent to Staten Island, or nearly one-fifth (19%) of all the soil the borough received, was destined for use in the transformation of the Fresh Kills Landfill into <a href="https://freshkillspark.org">Freshkills Park</a>.

				<p> In addition to providing soil to construction sites, the CSB also makes clean soil available to community organizations through the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/oer/safe-land/puresoil-nyc.page">PUREsoil NYC</a> program. The CSB has also facilitated <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204618300872">scientific research into soil contamination in NYC</a>.
